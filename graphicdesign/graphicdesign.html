              alt="A flyer for my local mosque's annual fundraising. I never made a lot of money in freelance - probably because I was always volunteering to do thing for a religious organization. Here's hoping God likes my work?">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/hotline.jpeg"
              alt="In the wake of the crazy of Drake's Hotline Bling, this T-Shirt design was reviewed and soundly rejected for my mosque's youth group, of which I was in charge at the time. I really thought it had merit.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/millennial-ad.jpeg"
              alt="My Youth Group, under my direction, put on our very first conference. It spanned two days, involved six mosques, and I unilaterally decided to theme it after Star Wars because the Force Awakens had just dropped their first trailer and I still had hope in the sequel trilogy.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/millennial.jpeg"
              alt="This was less of a teaser poster and more of a legitimate flyer once the event got off the ground. I ended up doing speaker posters, Instagram ads, printed six-foot tall banners, the works. I actually fully destroyed a laptop designing all of the print material for this event, just burnt the graphics card to ashes and dust.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/mosque.gif"
              alt="The president of the board at my mosque, a mentor of mine, calls me one evening and asks if I can help him design something. I get to the mosque, meet him in the office, and he tells me he needs to communicate what our expansion project will be doing for fundraising purposes. I am not a 3D modeler or animator, but Google Sketchup exists, and so does YouTube. So I did this, took screenshots of every 'camera movement', and stitched together an animated GIF.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/old-logo.png"
              alt="My first logo I ever designed for myself. I liked the mirrorred Ms. It felt like a really cool, modern look. Then I realized one day I had accidentally been a little too inspired by YouTuber MKBHD's logo, and had to change it.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/snap-filter.png"
              alt="My Youth Group was having a dinner, and the young folks wanted a Snapchat Filter for it. I decided to theme it after Harry Potter, and none of the adults noticed, they all thought I was doing some sort of historical theme.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/taqwa-logo.png"
              alt="I was contracted for a local Islamic Seminary program to help modernize their website and graphics. This was the first site I ever did UX for, even if I didn't realize that's what it was at the time.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/utep-logo.png"
              alt="The Muslim Student League at UT El Paso reached out to me for a logo, agreeing to the $150 I was charging them. I never got paid. They still got their logo. Such is the life of a freelance college student.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/youth-logo-three.jpeg"
              alt="Build-a-Basket was a youth program one of the kids I mentored came up with. We built a program where we advertised baskets of common goods, toiletries, foods, supplies, and toys, for some set donation amount. We ended up raising $20,000 in 20 days, and delivered these baskets to the refugee community in Dallas. I'd never been more proud of my kids than when they came back to the bus after walking in 100+ degree weather while fasting to hand baskets out door-to-door to these families.">

            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/youthlogo-one.png"
              alt="A logo I helped design for my youth group. They changed the logo almost every other year. This one lasted almost four or five.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/youth-logo-two.jpeg"
              alt="Again, after that Star Wars trailer I was somewhat enamored. So I redesigned our Youth Group logo to look like a LucasFilms logo. Then I had the idea that we could use that to promote a space-themed event. And then I had the idea to hold a youth conference.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/youthcard.jpeg"
              alt="This was an informational card we distributed at our mosque to let people know to get their kids involved. Honestly, the only reason I became a designer was because I used to mess around in PhotoShop at school, and one day a guy from the Youth Group asked me to design him a flyer, and the next decade of my life was devoted to the youth group after. The skills I learned in that service are what have set me up for success now.">

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/woc.png"
              alt="This is a booklet I designed, inlaid, and printed in the span of five days. From the request I received to the moment it went to print I was working feverishly around the clock to make this damn thing happen.">
