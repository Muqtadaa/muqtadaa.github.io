            <p>In the winter of 2019, my dear friend from high school, Shelby Johnson (Clinical Psychology, PhD candidate at Washington State), was finishing a post-graduate research essay. Put simply, she wrote about how multi-lingual people have a larger and more colorful emotional vocabulary, and built her essay around research that showed that the more articulate one is with describing how they feel, the easier it is for them to process those feelings.</p>
            
            <p>I had a brainwave, then, as someone who speaks multiple languages myself, and decided to make my graduating Capstone a user-experience that served as a multi-lingual emotional vernacular dictionary, to allow people to educate themselves and increase their own emotional intelligence. I rushed to speak to my professors about it, and though they thought the idea had merit, I was gently-but-firmly reminded that I ought not get too ambitious.</p>
            
            <p>It was Professor Cassini Nazir (formerly of UT Dallas, now at SMU) who pointed me in a new direction. We'd spoken in class about Dr. Robert Plutchik, a man who studied color theory as it related to emotional responses, and from there I had to sit down and figure out what exactly I was trying to make.</p>

          <h2>Framing the Design</h2>

        </div>
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="frameText">
      
        <p>I am a firm believer in using <a href="https://www.designkit.org/methods/frame-your-design-challenge" target="_blank">IDEO's Frame Your Design Kit</a> at the beginning of every project, to help clarify purpose, scope, and goalposts. The process gave me the following:</p>
        
        <h4>The Problem:</h4>
        
        <p>Developing emotional self-awareness and improving emotional well-being.</p>
        
        <h4>Framed as a Question:</h4>
        
        <p>How might we encourage self-awareness and growth?</p>
        
        <h4>The Ultimate Impact:</h4>
        
        <p>I want people to recognize what they're feeling, and have tools that they've learned to use in order to process those feelings.</p>
        
        <h4>Potential Solutions:</h4>
        
        <p>I found the following as usable tools in my research: increased emotional vocabulary, meditation, active awareness exercises, mood music, and intentional thought redirection.</p>
        
        <h4>Context? Constraints?</h4>
        
        <p>Emotions are uniquely individual to the individual, as redundant as that sounds. Any solution needs to be universally accessible to people of different backgrounds and education levels. I have to remember that I am attempting to complete a relatively large project for a single person, and not bite off more than I can chew.</p>
        
        <h4>Rephrase the Question:</h4>
        
        <h5 style="font-weight:400;text-align:center">How might people self-actualize through the use of healthy and accessible coping mechanisms?</h5>

          <h2>Exploratory Research</h2>

      <div class="researchText row">
      
        <div class="one-half column">
        
          <p>My research began with Dr. Robert Plutchik's Color Wheel of Emotions. This would serve as the foundation of my user experience. His research indicated that emotion consists of five components:</p>
          
          <ol style="font-weight:400;">
          
            <li>Emotion Component: where an individual simply experiences the feelings.</li>
            
            <li>Action Tendency Component: wherein the body moves in reaction to the feelings. Some of these responses are autonomous, others are controlled by the individual.</li>
            
            <li>Appraisal Component: this is where the individual thinks through the emotion, its source, related actions or stimuli, etc. Here is where words are usually first put to the feelings within one's mind.</li>
            
            <li>Motor Component: the communicative function of how to express the feelings being experienced, including facial expressions, hand gestures, body language, etc.</li>
            
            <li>Physiological Component: the chemical reactions undertaken by the body in response to emotional stimuli, such as the release of adrenaline, blood rushing to the head, jitters, shivers, etc. Social factors often influence these responses (i.e. gender, culture, race, sexuality, etc.).</li>
            
          </ol>
        
        </div>

          <p class="afterCap twelve columns">So the goal is to objectify and understand our emotions, empathize with ourselves (validating the self), and then channel the emotion productively (changing mood or taking action). From here, I began to develop a concept for the user experience.</p>

          <p>Based on a random sample size of 43, it seems that despite over 60% of people checking in with themselves at least frequently, the same proportion feel overwhelmed by their emotions with approximately the same frequency. This implies that a large number of people need help intuiting and processing their emotions on a regular basis, so I can safely say that my idea for a user experience has a definitive audience. My next step here is to identify specific user personas within that audience to model their <strong>behaviors and attitudes</strong> in relation to my intended user experience.</p>
          
          <p>Users also responded with their preferred methods of relaxing and improving their mood. The full list of responses <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZYuDpI0phvhht4lFQR2bxl4gvaCNO-W9eFgkiTkB-1I/viewanalytics" target="_blank">can be found here.</a></p>
          
          <p>My major takeaways were the following:
            
            <ul>
              
              <li>A little over <strong>50%</strong> of the polled audience were willing to use a product to help them keep track of their feelings better.</li>
              
              <li>The respondents had a lot of crossover in how they dealt with their emotions, with several methods appearing over and over. These indicate <strong>key features</strong> to include in any user experience addressing the larger question.</li>
