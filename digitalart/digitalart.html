        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/batman.jpg"
            alt="A heavy inking of Batman I drew after watching the first trailer for the Robert Pattinson film. My first few months in my first corporate gig out of college, this is how I would relieve stress - by doodling incessantly.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/dragonborn.png"
            alt="I drew this for a friend who made a D&D character by the name of Lucky the Lizard - an unfortunate Dragonborn Barbarian. Sadly, like most D&D stories, this campaign was so short-lived as to never happen.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/eyepencil.jpg"
            alt="This is an experiment in pencil drawing and shading, I was trying really hard to get a realistic look, all the while my manager was waiting for me to finish validating metrics for a test I was building.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/galaxy.jpg"
            alt="Using the fanciest of PhotoShop techniques as directed by a guide on YouTube, I created this galaxy as part of a promotional campaign where I was ripping off space-themed imagery from a popular Space Opera movie series.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/greenlantern.jpg"
            alt="This is none other than Hal Jordan himself - an experiment in flatting in colors and then using filters and effects to provide scale and depth. I like how this one turned out.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/joker.png"
            alt="This one was a doodle turned full-scale attempt at drawing a cartoonishly evil Joker, only it turned out a tad creepier than expected. This was drawn on a Microsoft SurfaceBook, great little machine aside from the fact that it burned through three NVIDIA graphics cards in two years.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/obama.png"
            alt="I had a project in school where I had to come up with a video game, I came up with 'President v. Aliens II, Return of the Obaminator.' Needless to say the concept was only a hit with classmates who identified as left-wing.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/robot.jpg"
            alt="After watching the introduction of Fresh Cut Grass on Critical Role's inaugural episode of campaign three, I found myself doodling liitle robot creatures with various personalities. This one is still my watch background.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/selfportrait.jpg"
            alt="This is a self-portrait I did when I was experimenting with an oily digital brush. I really like how it came out - I was terrified of ruining all my careful color placement when I started using a blending brush.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/spiderman.png"
            alt="My favorite drawing of Spiderman I've ever done, and I've been drawing him since I was six or seven years old. I love how dramatic the lighting turned out in this, purely by accident. I was attempting to cross-hatch, but then I realized it blended well with the webbing of his suit, and I got this really gnarly effect that I love.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/superman.png"
            alt="Another experiment in flatting in colors - this one is my man Supes. I had just read the Superman: Secret Identity and All Star Superman comics and couldn't stop drawing muscle-bound Kryptonians in tights.">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/theflash.jpg"
            alt="Back before I had a Wacom tablet or a smartphone with a stylus and a 7&quot; screen, I had a mouse and Adobe Flash. So I figured, why not draw THE Flash in Flash. Anyone else remember making Flash games using ActionScript and uploading to NewGrounds?">
        </div>

        <div class="gallery-item">
          <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/womanpencil.jpg"
            alt="This was done around the same time as the eye drawing above, but this time I kept the linework on a separate layer and allowed the blended pencil to create value. I love how this one turned out because I accidentally captured some kind of wistful moment without intending to.">
