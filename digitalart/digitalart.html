            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Aang.jpg"
              alt="I finally got an iPad, and my digital art improved dramatically. This was the first thing I drew on it, an homage to my love of Avatar the Last Airbender.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Aang_Breathing_Fire.jpg"
              alt="This was a study in making fire and playing with the lighting created by it. I used a reference image for the posing that really inspired the whole thing, I loved the implied movement in the figure.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/agdaron.png"
              alt="This is an original map of the world I created for my D&D campaign! We've been playing nearly 3 years, and the story has gotten quite exciting. We've had some incredible ups and downs.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Ahmed.jpg"
              alt="This is my very good friend Ahmed, we've been through a LOT of ups and downs together. I took a photo of him at a hookah bar in 2017, and it's one of the best photos I have of him. When I decided I was going to draw a person, I knew it had to be this photo.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Apocalypse_Mario.jpg"
              alt="I was in high school the first time I drew Mario as a realistic person living in a post-apocalyptic Mushroom Kingdom. Nearly a decade later I finally rendered a complete version of that idea. I tend to avoid drawing backgrounds as you can see, so clouds and colors it is!">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/batman.jpg"
              alt="A heavy inking of Batman I drew after watching the first trailer for the Robert Pattinson film. My first few months in my first corporate gig out of college, this is how I would relieve stress - by doodling incessantly.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Blue_Dragon.jpg"
              alt="This is my first attempt at painting something and removing the black linework I'm acccustomed to using, trying for a dash of realism in the process. I've been trying to draw a dragon for literally two decades so I am pretty pleased with how this came out. Tap on the image to play the timelapse of the drawing!">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Cinch.jpg"
              alt="This is the cute animal mascot for my company, Rent-A-Center. I always like to joke that he's Sonic the Hedgehog's distant cousin. We only have 3D model shots of him, so I just decided to sketch and draw up this 2D version of him.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/dragonvillage.jpg"
              alt="This is a map of a village my D&D players visited. I loved the idea of a village built around the ancient skeleton of a dragon. This was one of those images that inspired me to write neaerly 100 pages of lore, history, and character backstory.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/dragonborn.png"
              alt="I drew this for a friend who made a D&D character by the name of Lucky the Lizard - an unfortunate Dragonborn Barbarian. Sadly, like most D&D stories, this campaign was so short-lived as to never happen.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Duck_Team.jpg"
              alt="This is a rendition of the characters played by the cast of Not Another D&D Podcast (aka NADDPOD), the Duck Team. This podcast got me through some dark days with its lighthearted goofs and occasional heartfelt tearjerker moments. This was also drawn using Procreate on my iPad.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Eye_To_Eye_On_A_Mountaintop.png"
              alt="I finally let go of sketching first - just went with my gut and a nice brush and painted in some shapes until I saw the beginning of an image I liked. From there I did end up doing some sketching to outline details within the larger shapes, and then painted the rest in! I really love the composition of this one, tap the image for the timelapse video!">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/eyepencil.jpg"
              alt="This is an experiment in pencil drawing and shading, I was trying really hard to get a realistic look, all the while my manager was waiting for me to finish validating metrics for a test I was building.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Fantasy_Planet.jpg"
              alt="In my ever-expanding arsenal of fantasy map-making skills, I now include planetoids! This is the first time I started using other layers to mask in textures using specialty brushes. I really love how this turned out.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/galaxy.jpg"
              alt="Using the fanciest of PhotoShop techniques as directed by a guide on YouTube, I created this galaxy as part of a promotional campaign where I was ripping off space-themed imagery from a popular Space Opera movie series.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Ganondorf.png"
              alt="Tears of the Kingdom is one of the greatest games I've ever played - I have been so deeply inspired by it.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Girl.png"
              alt="I tried my hardest to paint this properly - using good traditional media techniques. Not my forte - I prefer to cheat using my graphic design skills.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/greenlantern.jpg"
              alt="This is none other than Hal Jordan himself - an experiment in flatting in colors and then using filters and effects to provide scale and depth. I like how this one turned out.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Isometric_Underground_Battlemap.jpg"
              alt="This is the first isometric battlemap I drew for Roll20 for my D&D campaign. It was a unique perspective challenge, and I had to figure out how the lighting was going to work. It ended up being a lot of fun to play on though.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/joker.png"
              alt="This one was a doodle turned full-scale attempt at drawing a cartoonishly evil Joker, only it turned out a tad creepier than expected. This was drawn on a Microsoft SurfaceBook, great little machine aside from the fact that it burned through three NVIDIA graphics cards in two years.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Logan_Poster.png"
              alt="This movie made me sad for literally days. I grew up on the superhero movies of the early 2000s, so X-Men and Wolverine were a big part of my childhood fantasies. I drew this as an homage to that and as an exercise in pencil work.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Mario_Pratt.png"
              alt="I drew this as a meme to post on Reddit, mocking the casting of Chris Pratt as the animated Mario. I think the caption is self-explanatory.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/obama.png"
              alt="I had a project in school where I had to come up with a video game, I came up with 'President v. Aliens II, Return of the Obaminator.' Needless to say the concept was only a hit with classmates who identified as left-wing.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/profileportrait.jpg"
              alt="This was my attempt at drawing someone from a profile - it sort of turned into a skinnier version of myself? I like what I did with this ultimately, I think it was a solid attempt at painting and lighting it.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/robot.jpg"
              alt="After watching the introduction of Fresh Cut Grass on Critical Role's inaugural episode of campaign three, I found myself doodling liitle robot creatures with various personalities. This one is still my watch background.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/selfportrait.jpg"
              alt="This is a self-portrait I did when I was experimenting with an oily digital brush. I really like how it came out - I was terrified of ruining all my careful color placement when I started using a blending brush.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/spiderman.png"
              alt="My favorite drawing of Spiderman I've ever done, and I've been drawing him since I was six or seven years old. I love how dramatic the lighting turned out in this, purely by accident. I was attempting to cross-hatch, but then I realized it blended well with the webbing of his suit, and I got this really gnarly effect that I love.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Spider-Man_Running.gif"
              alt="I've been playing with 2D animation lately - this was an attempt to capture a full sprint. Something is off about this - but I think mainly I just need to exaggerate the movement more and add some bounce to sell the strength of motion.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Superman.jpg"
              alt="A rendering of the original Chris Reeves portrayal of Clark Kent transforming into Superman. This is the first piece I've managed to realistically portray drapery and fabric. I'm really happy with how it turned out, though the hair could use some work.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/superman.png"
              alt="Another experiment in flatting in colors - this one is my man Supes. I had just read the Superman: Secret Identity and All Star Superman comics and couldn't stop drawing muscle-bound Kryptonians in tights.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/theflash.jpg"
              alt="Back before I had a Wacom tablet or a smartphone with a stylus and a 7&quot; screen, I had a mouse and Adobe Flash. So I figured, why not draw THE Flash in Flash. Anyone else remember making Flash games using ActionScript and uploading to NewGrounds?">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Wally_the_Bugbear.png"
              alt="For the first time in 5 years, I am playing a D&D character in a campaign. Not running the campaign, not playing a thousand and one NPCs, but my very own Player Character. This is Wally the Bugbear, a Junior Grub Scout of the Hobgoblin Dominion, Hashara. I'm having so much fun playing a snot-nosed teen as a shaman with a deep connection to nature.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Waterbending.gif"
              alt="I used to use a site called DoInk.com to create frame-by-frame animations when I was only 12 or 13 years old. Those animations were pretty simple stick figures, and it's good to know that 15 years later I'm still only capable of animating stick figures.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/Wizard.jpg"
              alt="I think this is the most ambitious drawing I've done up to this point on my iPad. I had a D&D character I've played in all of one session, a Wizard by the name of Athatar Ellerium. I've wanted to draw him for a long long time, and I'm super satisfied with how this one turned out.">
          </div>

          <div class="gallery-item">
            <img class="gallery-image" src="./art/womanpencil.jpg"
              alt="This was done around the same time as the eye drawing above, but this time I kept the linework on a separate layer and allowed the blended pencil to create value. I love how this one turned out because I accidentally captured some kind of wistful moment without intending to.">
